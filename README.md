# BSIM-CMG model (DC only) in Python

Updated: 3/28/2018

This is an attempt to write a working BSIM-CMG model in Python. Currently DC only. Also, RDSMOD = 0 only.

## Usage
Step 1: Add or modify model and instance parameters in 'modelcard.l'

Step 2: Run 'test.py' and see results.

Note: You can compare the results with commercial simulators like HSPICE.

Please help me debug this tool. Send feedback to huanlin@berkeley.edu
